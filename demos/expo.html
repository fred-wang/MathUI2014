    <h1>Firefox OS Web Apps for Science</h1>

    <h2>Software Description</h2>

    <p>Source: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox_OS">Firefox_OS article on MDN</a></p>

    <p>Firefox OS is a new mobile operating system, developed by Mozilla, and
    based on Linux and the Gecko engine that powers Firefox.</p>

    <p>For Web developers, the most important part to understand is that the
      entire user interface is a web app capable of displaying and launching
      other Web apps. Any modifications you make to the user interface and any
      applications you create to run on Firefox OS are web apps created using
      HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, albeit with enhanced access to the mobile
      device's hardware and services.</p>

    <p>For research, education, engineering and other domains where science and
      technical documents are used, one of the big advantage of working with Web
      technologies is that you can rely on
      Javascript, SVG, MathML, canvas, WebGL, Web components etc. to produce
      interactive documents and advanced mathematical user interfaces.

    <h2>Demonstrated Features</h2>

    <p>TODO</p>

    <p>See our <a href="index.html#web">Web demos</a> and
      <a href="index.html#apps">Firefox OS apps</a></p>

    <h2>Hardware Expectations</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>All the demos will be available offline.</li>
      <li>Access to a power socket would be helpful, especially if the session
        runs for a long time.</li>
      <li>We will have at least one
        <a href="http://asadotzler.com/2014/04/01/tablet-contribution-program-application-results">development version of a Firefox OS tablet</a> (perhaps two
        if the second one arrives in time) on which we can run the demos.
      </li>
      <li>We will also bring our own computers and will be able to run the
        demos on them.</li>
      <li>Should we rent an Android tablet to run the demos?</li>
    </ul>
