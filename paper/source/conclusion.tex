\section*{Conclusion}

The new features of HTML5 make it suitable to be used as the default way to
share knowledge in science and explain complex concepts more easily using
videos/animations or 3D-schemes for example. All the HTML5 features can be used
Firefox OS to build an science platform not only to consult knowledge but also
to generate new knowledge as show in some of the demos present in this papers.
