\chapter{Firefox OS}

\section{Overview}

Firefox OS is the open-source operating system targeting mobile devices being
developed by Mozilla and based on Web technologies. All the apps in Firefox OS
are Web pages running in Gecko and because of that all the technologies
presented in the previous chapter can be used with the addition of some special
API that currently are only available for Firefox OS due security issues, e.g.
access to file system, and/or features not available at desktops.

Scientific Web applications won't require the API only available at Firefox OS
devices and because of it a Scientific Web Ecosystem built to Firefox OS can
easily be available to others mobile devices and desktops.

In the next section we give more details of what we call ``Math Suite'' and
after that we present some of the demos wrote by Mozilla MathML community.

\section{Math Suite}

Like an office suite is a collection of softwares intended to be used by
knowledge workers an Math Suite is a collection of softwares intended to be used
by someone that make intensive use of math and should have tools like markup
converters, WYSIWYG editor, handwriting recognition and more.

Many of the applications in an Math Suite share a core set of functions and have
this functions available in a open source Javascript library will make easy to
develop new applications in the same way as Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms
(BLAS), a specification for common operations using scalar and vectors, wrote in
1979 are still used as a building block in higher-level math programming
languages and libraries.

The authors of this work start writing this Javascript libraries
and some demos that use it. At the moment we have a library to convert (La)TeX
to MathML and another one to basic arithmetic manipulation.
